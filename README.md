## Running Notebooks
Make sure that the dependencies are met. We recommend using a virtual environment to install and run the Jupyter Notebooks.

Create virtual environment:
```
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
```

Use virtual environment:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Jupyter:
```
jupyter notebook
```
